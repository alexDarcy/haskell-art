# Haskell-art

To learn and practice Haskell, I used the [diagrams
library](http://projects.haskell.org/diagrams/) to make some nice mathematical
plottings. 

## Hex variation

This is a transcription in Haskell of "Hex Variation" by William Kolmyjec. 
The algorithm itself is inspired from the version by Steve Berrick in the
[Recode project](http://recodeproject.com/artwork/v3n4hex-variation).
